# Impact of Global Boycott on Israel’s Economy  
### A Macro & Company-Level Economic Analysis (2015–2023)

## Project Overview

Global boycott movements can influence national economies through trade, tourism, consumption, and corporate performance.

This project analyzes the **economic impact of boycott-related pressures on Israel** by combining:

- **Macroeconomic indicators**  
  (GDP, inflation, employment, tourism, military spending)

- **Company-level performance data**  
  of major Israeli firms affected by boycott sentiment

The objective is **data-driven economic analysis**, not political commentary, using real-world indicators and business metrics.

## Data Sources & Research Approach

This project uses **two independent data sources**, highlighting both research depth and modern analytical workflows.

### 1. Macroeconomic Dataset

**Source:** World Bank – World Development Indicators (via API)

**Indicators analyzed:**
- GDP & GDP growth  
- Inflation & Consumer Price Index (CPI)  
- Unemployment & labor participation  
- Tourism arrivals & tourism receipts  
- Trade, consumption & military expenditure  

**What this demonstrates:**
- Strong research capabilities  
- Ability to work with **official global datasets**  
- Understanding of economic indicators used by governments and policy analysts

### 2. Company-Level Dataset

**Source:** AI-assisted research using **Perplexity**

**Data includes:**
- Top Israeli companies affected by boycott sentiment  
- Sector classification  
- Revenue & performance indicators  
- Exposure to exports, tourism, and global markets  

**What this demonstrates:**
- Practical use of **AI tools for research**  
- Ability to convert unstructured information into analysis-ready datasets  
- Modern, job-relevant analytical workflow

## Tools Used

### Microsoft Excel
- Data cleaning & validation  
- Dataset structuring  
- Preliminary analysis  

### Power BI
- Trend analysis dashboards  
- Sector-wise company comparisons  
- Macro vs micro impact visualization  
- Insight-driven storytelling

## Key Questions Explored

- Did Israel’s GDP and economic growth show volatility during boycott-intense periods?  
- Was tourism one of the earliest economic indicators to reflect impact?  
- How did inflation, consumption, and employment respond?  
- Were certain sectors more resilient than others?  
- Did defense-linked companies perform differently compared to consumer-facing firms?  
- Do company-level trends align with macroeconomic signals?  

---

## Key Insights (High-Level)

- Tourism-related indicators show higher sensitivity compared to core GDP metrics  
- Consumer-facing and export-dependent companies exhibit stronger impact signals  
- Defense and government-linked sectors demonstrate relative resilience  
- Macroeconomic stability can coexist with **sector-specific stress**  

*Insights are observational and analytical, not causal conclusions.*

## Why This Project Matters

This project reflects how a **Data Analyst approaches real-world problems**:

- Combines multiple datasets for stronger validation  
- Connects macroeconomic trends with company-level performance  
- Uses appropriate tools for analysis and storytelling  
- Focuses on **insights and interpretation**, not just visuals  

It demonstrates readiness for **Data Analyst / Business Analyst roles**, where context and reasoning matter as much as technical skills.
